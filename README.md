# inflation-data

Another interesting project was conducted by Dr. Usama Hussain, where he measured the rate of inflation by tracking the change of price of goods and services online. Considering that the BBC reports that the United States has seen the largest inflation rate since 2008, this is an important topic.

In this project, the author used petabytes of web page data contained in the Common Crawl.

I also think this is another great example of putting together and displaying a data engineering project. One of the challenges I often reference is how hard it can be to show off your data engineering work.

Here is the general outline.

Data Source: Inflation data
Ingestion Method: Spark
Data Storage: The raw data will be stored in an S3 bucket..
Data Transformations: Pandas
But Dr. Hussainâ€™s project is documented in a way that shows off what work was done and the skills that he has, without having to dig into all of the code.

Dr. Hussain outlines the data pipeline below.
